This is currently the API used in some of my projects for embedding, however the plan for this is to 
  1). Come up with the best solution for affordably using embeddings in a production-level environment,
  2). Create a model-on-model evaluation of different approaches (or maybe use that for live fine-tuning)
  3). Create some sort of way for others to modularly create an embedding API using their requirements (though this could likely just be a Terraform/SAM script but could be expanded for people not familiar with automating CICD)
